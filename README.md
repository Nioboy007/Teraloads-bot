  <h4> Downloading Terabox Files Using Only Termux ! </h4>
</div>

##

### What is Teraloads?
[**Teraloads**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Teraloads) is a script created using the Python programming language and functions to download videos or files on Terabox using the Termux application.

This program only functions to make it easier for you to download files from the Terabox application, nothing more!

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Teraloads
$ cd "Teraloads"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/Teraloads" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### Why failed to download?

- Empty or unavailable Terabox folder.
- Maybe because the download link has expired or the content is private.
- Please repeat using "AIRPLANE MODE" before you enter the Terabox link.

### Supported links?

- https://teraboxapp.com/s/....?
- https://www.4funbox.com/...?

### Why the download link was not found?

- This problem must be from Terabox, sometimes the download link fails or cannot be found.
- You just need to re-enter the download link.
- It's also possible that the link you entered is no longer valid.

### What if the connection is lost?
When your internet connection is lost you can wait because it automatically continues downloading files so you don't need to worry if the connection is lost or bad.
